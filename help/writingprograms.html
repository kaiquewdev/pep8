Welcome to the Pep/8 help system.
<p>
Pep/8 is a virtual machine for writing machine language and assembly language programs.
It is designed to be used with the textbook, <i>Computer Systems</i>, J. Stanley Warford, Fourth edition, Jones and Bartlett, Publishers, 2010.
The goal of the book is to teach the fundamentals of the classic von Neumann machine.
You should use the Pep/8 system in conjunction with the textbook to write machine language and assembly language programs.
<p>
 The next section, Machine Language, shows how to write a Pep/8 machine language program, load it, and execute it.
 The following section, Assembly Language, shows how to do the same with a Pep/8 assembly language program.
